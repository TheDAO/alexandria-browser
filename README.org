Welcome to ΛLΞXΛNDRIΛ !

* installing
ΛLΞXΛNDRIΛ is a simple web-app that we wraped in some node-webkit magic,
you have 3 ways of looking at it: directly, through a web server, as a
node-webkit app.

** pre-requesite
we use twitter's bower to install our dependencies, you need to install
bower and it's bower files:

#+begin_src shell
sudo npm install -g bower
bower install
#+end_src

** directly
just open your favorite webbrowser on the main html file, just works, w00t !

#+begin_src shell
firefox src/app/alexandria.html
#+end_src
** through a web server

you can easily install a small web server for testing purposes or deploy src
to your own
#+begin_src shell
sudo npm install -g http-server
cd src/app && http-server
#+end_src

now your app is served on http://localhost:8080
** node-webkit app
#+begin_src shell
npm install
bower install # yeah, just in case do it again
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
grunt dist
#+end_src

your node-webkit app is now in the build folder
